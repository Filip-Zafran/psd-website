    description: `New to Non-Monogamy? A Community Discussion Circle

Curious about ethical or consensual non-monogamy but not sure where to start?
Join us for an open and supportive circle where we’ll explore the many facets of non-monogamous life — from understanding key concepts to sharing real experiences within our Berlin community.
<br><br>
We’ll dive into topics such as:<br>

 - The differences between ENM (Ethical Non-Monogamy) and CNM (Consensual Non-Monogamy)
<br>
 - Common terminology and what these words mean in practice
<br>
 - Book recommendations and other resources to deepen your understanding
<br>
 - Events and communities in Berlin where you can connect and learn more
<br>
 - Behaviour and expectations within non-monogamous spaces
<br>
 - Dealing with metamours — navigating relationships with your partners’ partners
<br>
 - Can one get rid of jealousy, or is it something to embrace and understand?
<br><br>
Rather than a lecture, this is a knowledge-sharing circle — an open space for reflection, curiosity, and honest conversation among those exploring or already living non-monogamous lives.`
