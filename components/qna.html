        <summary>How it works?</summary>
        <p>Our speed dating events consist of timed rounds (3-5 minutes) where you'll meet different people in a structured way. 
        There are breaks between rounds to take notes and catch your breath. 
        After all rounds, you'll submit an opt-in form indicating who you'd like to stay in touch with. 
        We only share matches when there's mutual interest!</p>

        <summary>Application process (dates & info)</summary>
        <p>Check our Apply page for upcoming dates → Submit the Google Form → Wait for confirmation email 
        (usually within 1 week) → Arrive prepared (phone charged for check-in, open mind ready). 
        Space is limited so we recommend applying early.</p>
